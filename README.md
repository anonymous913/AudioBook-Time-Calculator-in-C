## Project Overview:
This program is designed to help you track the total time you spend listening to audiobooks. By inputting the hours and minutes listened, along with the playback speed, the AudioBook Time Calculator will compute the total listening time in minutes. **The formula used is:** 

 **[ Total Time = {Hours * 60 + Minutes} / Playback Speed ]**

Simply enter the required values, and the program will display the calculated total listening time.



## Programming Languages Used:  
``` - C ```
